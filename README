Instruction and resource repository for the excersises on the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)

Instructions: 

1. Create an account on CDS an explore the site a bit - pay attention to the "Datasets", "Applications" and the "Toolbox"
   -> https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/

2. Go to the Toolbox documentation and explore the Application Gallery
   -> https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/gallery/51_heatmap_by_city.html

3. Search the application "Heatmap by city" - lets have a look a the Python code together.
   Open te code in the Toolbox (use the red link)

4. The application is opened in the Toolbox. Click on the red button (Copy) to copy the application to your workspace.

5. Explore the application, add a city of your choice to it.

6. Add the new cities dictionaty below (copy paste) and comment out the old dictionary:

cities = OrderedDict({   # (cities taken from the PHEWE project)
    'Helsinki': {'lat': 60.1102, 'lon': 24.7385},
    'Stockholm': {'lat': 59.3262,'lon': 17.8419},
    'Dublin': {'lat': 53.3239, 'lon': -6.5258},
    'Rotterdam': {'lat': 51.9130, 'lon': 4.4539},
    'London': {'lat': 51.5287,'lon': -0.2416},
    'Prague': {'lat': 50.0598,'lon': 14.3255},
    'Krakow': {'lat': 50.0468,'lon': 19.9348},
    'Paris': {'lat': 48.8589,'lon': 2.2769},
    'Budapest': {'lat': 47.4813,'lon': 18.9902},    
    'Zurich': {'lat': 47.3775,'lon': 8.4666},    
    'Ljubljana': {'lat': 46.0662,'lon': 14.4620},    
    'Milan': {'lat': 45.4628,'lon': 9.1076},    
    'Bucharest': {'lat': 44.4379,'lon': 26.0245},   
    'Rome': {'lat': 41.9097,'lon': 12.2558},    
    'Barcelona': {'lat': 41.3927,'lon': 2.0701},    
    'Athens': {'lat': 37.9908,'lon': 23.7033},    
})

7.  Describe how you would change this application to depict heatmaps for climate projections:
    a) which new dataset can be used for this (from the CDS)?
    b) which procedures of the old application will have to be adapted/changed/added?
    c) how to create the parameter list for the ct.catalogue.retrieve method?
    d) how to extract 12 months from the projection data collection?
    d) how to add a file download instruction to the application?
    
 8) A solution file (including some changes in the layout of the application) can be downloaded from this project.
    To apply the propsed solution, copy the content of this file and paste is to a new (empty) application in the 
    Toolbox by using the "+" button in your workspace.
    
 9) Which further steps are relevant to create more reliable information about projected ambient temperatures?
    (e.g. add more simulations/ensembles, perform bias correction)
